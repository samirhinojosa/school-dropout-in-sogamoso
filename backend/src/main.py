This project is part of [Data Science 4 All - DS4A](https://www.correlation-one.com/data-science-for-all-colombia) \
training ðŸš€, and has two main objectives:

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li>
        Building a classification model that will give a prediction about the probability of a student dropouts the school.<br>
        The model will be treated as a <strong>binary classification problem</strong>. So, 0 will be the class who does not
        dropout the school and 1 will be the class who dropouts the school.
    </li>
    <li>
        Build an interactive <strong>dashboard</strong> for <a href="https://www.sogamoso-boyaca.gov.co/" target="blank">Sogamoso municipality</a> 
        to interpret the predictions made by the model, and improve the  knowledge to allows the making-decision.
    </li>
