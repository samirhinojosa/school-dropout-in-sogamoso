# SCHOOL DROPOUT IN SOGAMOSO

This project is part of [Data Science 4 All - DS4A](https://www.correlation-one.com/data-science-for-all-colombia) training, and has two main objectives
- Building a classification model that will give a prediction about the probability of a student dropouts the school.
  The model will be treated as a **binary classification problem**. So, 0 will be the class who does not dropout the school and 1 will be the class who dropouts the school.
- Build an interactive **dashboard** for [Sogamoso municipality](https://www.sogamoso-boyaca.gov.co/) to interpret the predictions made by the model, and improve the  knowledge to allows the making-decision.
