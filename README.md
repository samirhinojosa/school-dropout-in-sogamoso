# SCHOOL DROPOUT IN SOGAMOSO #
 
This project is part of [Data Science 4 All - DS4A](https://www.correlation-one.com/data-science-for-all-colombia)  training, and has two main objectives:

* Building a classification model that will give a prediction about the probability of a student dropouts the school. The model will be treated as a binary classification problem. So, 0 will be the class who does not dropout the school and 1 will be the class who dropouts the school.
* Build an interactive dashboard for Sogamoso municipality to interpret the predictions made by the model, and improve the knowledge to allows the making-decision.

In this repository you can find all the source code composed by three parts:
* Backend: FastApi app with all the responses from the model and the historic data stored on the db.
* Frontend: Streamlit development with insights, dashboards and students dropout prediction.
* Notebooks: All the proccess involved in the lifecycle in order to develop a prediction model. (Juoyter)
